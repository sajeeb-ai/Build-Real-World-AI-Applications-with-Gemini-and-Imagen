# Build-Real-World-AI-Applications-with-Gemini-and-Imagen

## 1. Build an AI Image Recognition app using Gemini on Vertex AI - genai.py

Code Explanation
The code snippet is loading a pre-trained AI model called Gemini (gemini-1.0-pro-vision) on Vertex AI.
The code calls the generate_content method of the loaded Gemini model.
The input to the method is an image URI and a prompt containing a question about the image.
The code uses Gemini's ability to understand images and text together. It uses the text provided in the prompt to describe the contents of the image.
