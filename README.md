# Build-Real-World-AI-Applications-with-Gemini-and-Imagen

## 1. Build an AI Image Recognition app using Gemini on Vertex AI - genai.py

Code Explanation:

The code snippet is loading a pre-trained AI model called Gemini (gemini-1.0-pro-vision) on Vertex AI.

The code calls the generate_content method of the loaded Gemini model.

The input to the method is an image URI and a prompt containing a question about the image.

The code uses Gemini's ability to understand images and text together. It uses the text provided in the prompt to describe the contents of the image.

## 2. Build an AI Image Generator app using Imagen on Vertex AI - GenerateImage.py

Code Explanation:

The code snippet is loading a pre-trained AI model called ImageGenerationModel (imagegeneration@002) on Vertex AI.

The code calls the generate_image method of the loaded Gemini model.

The input to the method is a text prompt.

The code uses Gemini's ability to understand the text prompt and use it to build an AI Image.

## 3. Build an application to send Chat Prompts using the Gemini model - SendChatwithoutStream.py

Code Explanation:

The code snippet is loading a pre-trained AI model called Gemini (gemini-1.0-pro) on Vertex AI.

The code calls the get_chat_response method of the loaded Gemini model.

The input to the method is a text prompt.

The code uses Gemini's ability to chat. It uses the text provided in the prompt to chat.

## 4. Build an application to send Chat Prompts using the Gemini model - SendChatwithStream.py
